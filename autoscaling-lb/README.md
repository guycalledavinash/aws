This project demonstrates a production environment where I create a VPC, deploy the servers in two availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. To secure the IP addresses, Bashtion host/Jump server comes to rescue. For additional security, the servers are in private subnets, receive requests through the load balancer and can connect to the internet using a NAT gateway. Check the below image for reference.
